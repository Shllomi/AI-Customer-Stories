_**Financial Services**_
------------------------
**Example 1**    
[Example ](https://example.com)   

**Itaú Unibanco**    
Pix on WhatsApp is one of the first solutions connected to Inteligência Itaú and uses generative AI to interact with clients through WhatsApp and make day-to-day transfers in an automated and instant way.

**Experity**    
Experity Launches Care Agent: The First Clinical Intelligence Solution for Urgent Care. [Read-More](https://www.experityhealth.com/news/experity-launches-care-agent-the-first-clinical-intelligence-solution-for-urgent-care/)   

_**Insurance**_
------------------------
**Travelers**    
Foundation model(FM)-based classifier through prompt engineering: Travelers receives millions of emails a year with agent or customer requests to service policies. The system Travelers built uses the predictive capabilities of FMs to classify complex, and sometimes ambiguous, service request emails into several categories. This FM classifier powers the automation system that can save tens of thousands of hours of manual processing and redirect that time toward more complex tasks. With Anthropic’s Claude models on Amazon Bedrock, we formulated the problem as a classification task, and through prompt engineering and partnership with the business subject matter experts, we achieved 91% classification accuracy.

_**Public Sector**_
------------------------
**US Navy COMSUBFOR (Commander, Submarine Force)**    
COMSUBFOR developed an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution with a complex Amazon Open Search architecture, proving separate indexes for each submarine to accommodate their unique technical specifications. Powered by Amazon Bedrock Agents on Amazon Bedrock, the solution implements an AI-driven system and creates an agentic architecture that consults vector databases, searches the COMSUBFOR website for information, and generates specific Navy Official Forms.

**US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**    
Intelligent document processing solution: The team built intelligent document processing solutions, powered by Anthropic models on AmazonBedrock to address labor intensive processes of assessing chemical risk and review and regulate pesticides in the U.S. Both solutions leverage intelligent document processing using Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon Textract, as well as incorporating knowledge bases and criteria from EPAs own data stores. Most importantly, the heavy lifting of assessing, comparing, evaluating is done by generative AI, but the humans remain in the loop and in control, accepting or modifying the AI generated evaluations before finalizing decisions.[Read-More](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/accelerating-workflows-with-generative-ai-epas-document-processing-journey/)   

_**Education**_
------------------------
**The University of Texas at Austin**    
UT Sage: A virtual instructional designer and AI Tutor designed by UT Austin experts to support the responsible use of generative AI in teaching and learning, Built on
AmazonBedrock and powered by Anthropic Claude models. [Read-More](https://provost.utexas.edu/the-office/academic-affairs/office-of-academic-technology/ut-sage/)   

_**Education Tech (EdTech)**_
------------------------
**Renaissance**    
Renaissance Learning and AWS collaborated to build a solution that automatically analyzes and categorizes educational content, mapping items to relevant state standards using natural language processing. Built on Amazon Bedrock and leveraging Amazon OpenSearch for information retrieval, AWS Lambda for serverless processing, the solution intelligently maps content and learns from existing mapped content to improve accuracy. The solution also provides confidence scores for mapped relationships.

_**Legal Tech (EdTech)**_
------------------------
**Robin AI**    
LLM-as-a-jury: Robin AI accelerates contract work for legal professionals using AI-powered tools combined with expert legal knowledge. Their legal assistant traditionally relied on human experts to assess AI-generated legal answers, a process they have now begun to automate and scale through a partnership with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center. Robin AI employed an LLM-as-a-judge approach using Amazon #Bedrock with Amazon #Nova Pro and Anthropic's #Claude 3 Haiku to serve as an LLM "jury." These foundation models were fine-tuned on data from over 500 contracts across nine types and guided by expert feedback to evaluate and improve the quality of AI-generated legal responses, incorporating prompt optimization, data augmentation, and iterative model training for enhanced accuracy and reliability.
